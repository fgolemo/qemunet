### NEW REPO LOCATION ###

Originally I created this repo for my students because they needed to access the original author's code and the code was behind a login that they couldn't access.
Now the original author contacted me that he moved his repository to GitHub.
Therefore this repo isn't required anymore and I'd encourage everyone to use the original author's code
directly:

https://github.com/orel33/qemunet
